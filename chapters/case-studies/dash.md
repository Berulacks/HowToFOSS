## What Is Dash?

[Dash](https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Dash) is a free and open source 3D game engine. The following is a summation of the [full history](https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Dash/wiki/Engine-History) of Dash:

> But what should Dash be? At first we thought it should be a résumé piece, but that seemed too short-sighted. Some sort of undergraduate capstone project to show the school administration they should provide a more legitimate offering for large projects? Yes, but that's no way to focus an engine. A way to show game developers that C++ has competition? Definitely! What about giving back to the open source community? Absolutely, the sharing of knowledge is the only reason any of us got to where we are now. And what have XNA/Monogame been up to since we started working on this? We could push the programmer-facing game engine aspect forward by providing modern features that can fill the gap between Monogame and Unity. Now we're talking.

## Why Open Source?

Dash went the open source route for a number of the same reasons that many projects choose to open source: increased visibility, giving to / getting support from like-minded developers, and better project management. Keep in mind this wasn't an overnight decision: Dash developers come from the land of game development, which has a pretty bad track record with open source, and we were no exception. The prior iterations of Dash had been closed, both because we hadn't been introduced to the idea of open source development and because the engine was so closely tied to whatever game was being worked at the time that the code repositories were inseparable.

When we decided to rebuild the engine in D and make it open source, it was also decided that we should have a game team developing a game alongside the engine. This has a number of benefits that are covered [here](http://blog.danieljost.com/the-vision-of-circular-studios-fall-2014/), but one thing to point out is that the game was kept closed source. This is important to bring up: *not all projects are better as open source projects*. Games haven't really figured out how to be open source and commercially successful (not to discount modding). Code is one thing, but art assets and game design documents are not built to be shared for free, publicly. That is not to say we did not take advantage of GitHub's issues, pull requests, and open source-style development. And we are talking about open sourcing the project if we move on without the intention to make profit.

All that to say, evaluate your project's needs upfront and decide if open source makes the most sense. By reading this book you are better informing yourself of the option to open source and the benefits it brings to a project.
