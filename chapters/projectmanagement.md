# How to Manage a FOSS Project

> This effort is aided by the fact that people generally show up expecting and looking for social norms. That's just how humans are built. In any group unified by a common endeavor, people who join instinctively search for behaviors that will mark them as part of the group. The goal of setting precedents early is to make those "in-group" behaviors be ones that are useful to the project; once established, they will be largely self-perpetuating.

## Setting the Tone

* Avoid Private Discussions
* Nip Rudeness in the Bud
* Practice Conspicuous Code Review
* Be Open From Day One
* When Opening a Formerly Closed Project, be Sensitive to the Magnitude of the Change
