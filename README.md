# How To FOSS

This book was compiled during an Independent Study course at Rochester Institute of Technology, in conjunction with the MAGIC Center. In it, you will find a collection of information that explain how to get started in the free and open source community.

## Authors

[Daniel Jost](https://github.com/PxlBuzzard) and [Colden Cullen](https://github.com/ColdenCullen) have worked together on nearly every project throughout their years at RIT. After taking the Advanced FOSS course taught by [Remy DeCausemaker](https://github.com/decause), they decided to obtain the [Free and Open Source Software & Free Culture](http://magic.rit.edu/foss/minor.html) minor in their final semester. This book fulfills a portion of the minor, and will act as a curriculum for future FOSS classes.

[Daniel Jost](https://github.com/PxlBuzzard) has always been interested in how things work. Whether it was doing Public Relations for game mods like [Conflict Earth 2142](http://www.moddb.com/mods/conflict-earth-2142), [modifying the stylesheets](https://userstyles.org/users/14920) of various websites, or majoring in Game Design & Development at RIT, Daniel lives with the engineer's mantra to be curious. He will be graduating as one of the first students to ever hold a minor in Free and Open Source Software & Free Culture. He has accepted a full-time position at Microsoft where he will be working with web technology.
