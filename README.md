# How To FOSS

This book was compiled during an Independent Study course at Rochester Institute of Technology, in conjunction with the MAGIC Center. In it, you will find a collection of information that explain how to get started in the free and open source community.

## Authors

[Daniel Jost](https://github.com/PxlBuzzard) and [Colden Cullen](https://github.com/ColdenCullen) have worked together on nearly every project throughout their years at RIT. After taking the Advanced FOSS course taught by [Remy DeCausemaker](https://github.com/decause), they decided to obtain the [Free and Open Source Software & Free Culture](http://magic.rit.edu/foss/minor.html) minor in their final semester. This book fulfills a portion of the minor, and will act as a curriculum for future FOSS classes.
